# Language Speed Dating

I'm a front-end web developer, which means I'm a JavaScript developer. This has
been both a curse and an asset, given how confusing, exciting, confounding, and
useful the language can be. Today most of my colleagues and I are TypeScript
converts that recognize both the good (excellent async, immutabile operations,
and data manipulation) and the bad (prototypes, reflection, globals, function
scoping, clunky immutability).

But as ES, JS, and TS continue to evolve, it's becoming clear to more and more
front-end devs that this ecosystem isn't always the best tool for the job. TS
and JS are often at odds with one another to the point where valid, bug-free JS
might be invalid TS. And the performance of popular builders like Babel and
Webpack has become a bottleneck for teams with large code bases. Like their
Python and Ruby counterparts JS devs are turning to higher performance,
strictly typed languages like Rust and Go with more frequency.

So I set out to teach myself Rust and Go. I'll discuss the quirks and tradeoffs
I found here. I'm also going to include Deno, since it can act as a base case
for JS devs like me that are looking for a tight ecosystem with strict typing
(mostly) and a focus on performance.

In general, Deno, Go, and Rust all sit at slightly different altitutes when it comes
to "level", and this is fine. Deno may be the easiest to pick up for JS people
and non-devs alike, Rust's intense focus on memory safety can be
difficult for beginners, and Go sits somewhere in between.

I'll go point by point, discussing attributes I found particularly interesting.
This list is hardly meant to be exhaustive (or very accurate) so please don't
email me (or do?).

## Setup

Setup for all three languages is extremely easy. This speaks to how far the
programming world has come since I was in college, when it took me a day
to get going with anything. I credit both the Ruby and Node communities for
pushing for things like readable error messages and suggestions for fixes
that make installation and compilation much more friendly.

### Deno

Deno comes with a compiler, linter, formatter, bundler, and language server.
Some of it is written in JS, but the bulk is written in Rust. This makes
compiling and running `js` and `ts` files very fast. Deno scripts can actually
be compiled down to executables, which is pretty cool for JS.

Unlike Node, it comes with nearly every browser API built in. Things
like `fetch` and `Performance` just work. It's standard library is based on
Go's, which means things like `lodash` are mostly unnecessary. Also unlike Node,
modules are imported by URL (like they are in the browser). This can feel
unsafe if you aren't using a reliable cdn or your own server, but it's
safe enough for the W3C.

Setting up the language server, linter, and formatter to work with neovim,
my preferred editor, was straightfoward and awesome.

### Go

Go comes with a compiler, a formatter, and a version controller. Like Deno,
running a Go program is as easy as `go run ./my-script.go`, but because Go
is entirely functional, files must have a `main` function as well as
some basic imports to do anything of interest.

I couldn't get `gfmt` to work in neovim, but I'm pretty sure this was my fault.
That said, the lack of a standard language server is pretty strange, given how
hot those are right now.

Importing Go packages is similar to Deno, in that they are specified by URL.

### Rust

Rust comes with `cargo`, it's CLI swiss army knife. Cargo is a compiler,
linter, formatter, language server, dependency manager. Rust programs can
import external packages, but they are specified the name registered to
`crates.io`, the community registry. This will feel similar to Node users
that are familiar with NPM.

Setting up neovim to use `cargo` was about as easy as it was with Deno, which
is great.

Incidentally, the Rust compiler will actually suggest fixes for mistakes like
mispellings, and will give friendly lint warnings about things like camel case
(which violates the style guide).

## Memory Management

This is probably where the languages differ the most and may be the main
deciding factor in choosing one. I'll try to be as sussinct as possible.

### Deno

Memory in Deno is managed exactly the same way as it is in Node or the browser.
That is to say, primitive values are allocated to the stack and passed by value,
and everything else is allocated on the heap and passed by reference. Memory
is freed using garbage collection. There is no such thing as a pointer.

// PUT THIS SOMEWHERE ELSE?
This simplicity, paired with the ease of writing Deno scripts, makes it a
great choice for making simple tools that aren't performance sensitive.

### Go

Memory in Go is slightly more complicated, but not much. Data is copied by
default or passed by reference using `&`. Go will decide to allocate to the
heap if it determines that data is intended to go out of scope, like if a
function declares a struct and returns it. Go also has garbage collection.

For JS people, the "copy by default" behavior can be confusing at first, but it
prevents a lot of the bugs caused by shared references and is actually pretty convenient if
you're used to seeing `array = [...array, item]` rather than `array.push(item)`
in your code base.

### Rust

Memory allocation in Rust is entirely up to the developer. When memory is allocated,
it is explicitly allocated to the stack or the heap. Assignment determines "ownership"
or scope where the memory will be allocated. Data is only available for
the life of its scope, and the compiler will error out if you try to return data
allocated and assigned within a function (for example).

Unlike Go (and JS), Rust has strict rules about the amount of references that
can exist to any given piece of data. In particular, there can only exist one
mutable reference at a time. This can make all sorts of things that would be
simple in JS, nearly impossible in Rust, like modifying a Vector while looping
over it.

Rust also makes a distinction between "copying" and "cloning". Like Go, Rust
will copy assigned values by default, but unlike Go, these values must be
"copyable". Basic values like integers and arrays are copyable, but most
dynamic data structures like Vectors and HashMaps are not. Most data can be
cloned, but `clone()` is an explicit call. This distinction reflects the
underlying performance of the hardware and is representative of Rust's
desire to steer programmers toward high performance.

Rust also doesn't have a concept of null. All variables must point to a value, which
prevents bugs caused by dangling pointers. (Rust also has structs designed to act like
null.)

In general, all these rules forced me to write better code and be much more
cognizant of how much memory I was using, but they could also be extremely
frustrating. Rust's approach to memory management is the biggest barrier
for most people and probably the main reason it's not more widely used. But
if we're talking about ease of use, it's probably unfair to compare Rust
to Go. The real point of comparison should be C++, which, despite its
storied history, makes it really easy to do things like leak memory
and attempt to access data not owned by the program.

## Paradigms

### Deno

Like JS, TypeScript is both functional and class-based. Most front-end organizations
I encounter these days tend to prefer functional programming because
it makes it easier to handle and copy the data that flows through their programs
without having to deal with any of the opacity and inheritence trees of class instances.

That said, many browser APIs are still class based, so the keyword `new` is generally unavoidable.

In general, JS is old enough and has so many features, that there are often many ways to do
the same thing, and most devs will find themselves using a subset of its "good" features.

### Go and Rust

Both Go and Rust are functional, but they also allow programmers to associate functions with
structured data using interfaces and traits. This simple setup is what a lot of the JS programmers
that avoid the word `class` wish they had, but it's unlikely that JS will ever get an equivalent.

## The Rest of The Stuff

This last part will be a quick summary of the features I found most interesting in each
of these languages and their existent (or non-existent) equivalents in the others. But the
most important difference that underlies a lot of these quirks is that the current version of
Go does not support generics. This is **HUGE** and makes a lot of the things JS and Rust devs
take for granted nearly impossible. But Go is introducing generics soon, and it could mean
big changes to a lot of its standard libraries.

### Type Inference

All three languages have some level of type inference, but Go requires that devs explicitly
indicate when they want inference to be performed using `:=`.

```typescript
let num = 0;
let num: number = 0;
```

```go
  num := 0;
  var num int = 0;
```

```rust
  let num = 0;
  let num: int = 0;
}
```

### Copying Data

#### Deno

```javascript
let newData = structuredClone(data);
```

#### Go

```go
  newData := data
```

#### Rust

```rust
  // copy
  let newData = data;
  // clone
  let newData = data.clone();
```

### Iterators

Both JS and Rust have iterators that work fairly similarly, but most of the array methods
JS devs are used to (map, reduce), exist on Rust iterators instead. In practice, this
leads to more performant code, because data is processed lazily, and slices are not
repeatedly copied.

Rust iterators also have the very convient `collect` method that magically converts them
into the data structure of your choice.

Something clunky like

```javascript
const usersById = new Map(users.map(user => [user.id, user]));
```

becomes

```rust
let users_by_id: Map<usize, User> = users.iter().map(|user| (user.id, user)).collect();
```

Go has a lot of things that look like iterators (like `bufio.Scanner`), but because it
lacks generics, they do not necessarily share common methods. This means all of the neat
iterator and array methods available in JS and Rust are not there in Go, which IMO sucks
and makes processing data much more of a headache.

### Generators

Only JS currently has generators. Rust has some version of them in a nightly build, which
means they're on the horizon, but until then its pretty difficult to write a function that
returns an iterator without implementing a custom iterator yourself. (I actually did this
to calculate permutations of a vector for a coding exercise.)

Because Go desn't even have iterators, generators are probably pretty far off.

### Tuples

Because Deno is running TypeScript, it has a concept of tuples, but because it's a superset of JS,
tuples are actually just arrays of a fixed size.

Rust tuples are actually their own data type and work much like they do in Python. Both Rust tuples
and JS tuples allow functions to return multiple values.

Go does not have tuples (again, because of generics), but it does allow functions to return
multiple values.

### Errors and Error Handling

JS has the try/catch we all know and love. Rust and Go take similar but
slightly different approaches to error handling.

Go functions will often return two values: the desired result and a possible
error. If one of these values is `nil`, then the other will have data.

Rust has a special enum type `Result`, that can either contain an error or a
value.

### Pattern Matching

Only Rust has pattern matching, the coolest piece of syntax in any language.

### Destructuring

JS has supported destructuring assigments for a while, but Go does not. Rust's
version of it dovetails with its pattern matching and is probably more powerful but
not exactly the same.

```javascript
try {
  const { id: userId } = getUser();
  console.log("the user's id is", userId);
} catch (error) {
  console.log('ther user is not logged in.');
}
```

```rust
match get_user() {
  Some(User {id}) => {
    println!("the user's id is {}", id);
  },
  _ => {
    println!("the user is not logged in.");
  }
}
```

### Returning Values

Values must be explicitly returned in JS and Go using the `return` statement.

Rust functions, like those in Ruby, will return the result of their last expression. In fact,
all expressions in Rust resolve to a value. This means that ternaries are unnecessary
(and non-existent).

```rust
fn at_least(value: int, min: int) -> int {
  if value < min {
    min
  } else {
    value
  }
}
```

`return` can still be used for early returns.

### Loops

Coming from JS loops, Rust loops can feel similar. `for in` allows iterating over in iterator,
and `while` will continue to loop as long as its expression is true. Infinite loops are simply
`loop`, and `break` and `continue` are available.

Rust also supports looping over ranges.

```rust
// with an iterator
for value in values.iter() {
  print!("{}", value);
}

// with a range
for i in 0..values.len() {
  print!("{}", values[i]);
}

// while
let mut i = 0;
while i < values.len() {
  print!("{}", values[i]);
  i += 1;
}

// infinite
let mut i = 0;
loop {
  if i >= values.len() {
    break;
  }
  print!("{}", values[i]);
  i += 1;
}
```

Go has one type of loop, `for`, but it covers all cases. Because it doesn't have iterators,
it provides a `range` keyword that pulls out members of a collection.

```go
for i, value := range values {
  fmt.Print(value);
}

for i := 0; i < len(values); i += 1 {
  fmt.Print(values[i])
}

i := 0
for i < len(values) {
  fmt.Print(values[i])
  i += 1
}

i := 0
for {
  if i >= len(values) {
    break
  }
  fmt.Print(values[i])
  i += 1
}
```
