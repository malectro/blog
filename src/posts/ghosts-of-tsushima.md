Ghost is an almost algorithmic master class. The combat is souls-y, the open world gorgeous, the menus quick to navigate, the plot serviceable, abilities fun to deploy. But at times it is almost too clean. Looking at a map of indicators and finding the next box to check off can make you feel a bit like a rat on a treadmill, achieving what game designers like to call, a Flow State.

Toward the end of my time as The Ghost, I'd just fast traveled to my second camp and killed a bunch of enemy soldiers to liberate another farming town. I felt this ennui utterly. My life was ticking by.

But I knew there was something good in this game. I noticed I'd left much of the northeast unexplored so I closed the map and started riding slowly up the coast. In the distance I saw a lighthouse and made it my implied destination. I ignored a quest-giving bird to stop and take a few photos. I liberated another town, but it felt more like I'd stumbled upon it, my mind weaving stories about its coastal terroir. When I reached the lighthouse I was able to look back and take in the terrain I'd covered, each point of interest dotting the hills and bluffs. I gazed further north and could see snow falling. Onward.
