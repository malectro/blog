2020 has been a bleak year, but for me it's also been a return to video games. I imagine a lot of millenials who thought they'd moved on from this adolescent hobby found themselves locked inside and drawn back in, which made it all the more fitting that many of the best sellers of the year were remakes of games from that same adolescence. Here we were, reliving our childhoods while reliving our childhoods.

But these releases approached their goals in ways that made "remake" into a much more nebulous term. What does it mean to remake a game? Why do it at all? What parts of the original experience should be "improved" or updated? As these questions pile up, "remaking" starts to look more like translating Beowulf – a futile exercise in loss of information that results in something worthwhile – something new.

Here's a simplistic question. Why not remake Super Mario World, one of the greatest games of all time? The answers are manifold. It's great already. It's rereleased on different platforms all the time. Its legacy lives on in thousands of side-scrolling platformers – including other Mario games. But Nintendo has never explicitly remade it, and I'd argue this is because the format was mature at the time of the release. Nobody playing it today wonders "what if this looked better?", and despite the fact that platformers aren't the most popular with younger generations, it's hardly primitive or alienating in the way another genre defying game, Adventure, might be to modern audiences. You could even argue that side-scrolling platformers haven't evolved at all since Super Mario World.

But the generation that came after was primitive. This was an era when hardware had only begun to allow real time rendering of simple shapes. Players had to make leaps of imagination in order to transform polygons into animated characters. Mario 64, the era's gold standard, was gorgeous (and still is), but its polygons, blurry trees, and clunky camera controls can feel dated.

To reintroduce these games to modern audiences, and make them enjoyable again to old ones, studios have decided they need remaking. But what to preserve and what to upgrade?

The simplest remake is a graphical upgrade that leaves the mechanics untouched. This kind of remake acknowledges both the perfection of the original mechanics and the failures of the less pleasing visuals. Demon Souls, a seminal title that somehow flew under the radar, got this treatment recently with its remaster for PlayStation 5. Playing it can feel like treading on holy ground. You wonder if, along with the developers, we're all a little too afraid to ask why spending an hour running up and down stairs looking for The Monumental is a valuable use of time.

But in leaving most of itself unchanged, it gives us something fairly rare, a chance to experience what so many people missed the first time around. Here is the dodging, parrying, and slashing of the Souls genre, all fully realized at its point of inception. We can appreciate something both risky and new without the feeling of being a gamer historian, squinting at upscaled pixels.

Tony Hawk: Pro Skater 1+2 dropped in the early Fall with a similar premise. After decades of mediocre sequels that iterated on the gameplay, a graphical overhaul was dropped, but unlike DS, with a few notable improvements.

It's hard to imagine this, but the original THPS was released in an era of quick sequels. Today we might wait a couple years for Miles Morales to get his due, but the first 3-4 THPS games were dropped year after, each with more levels and improvements. The genius of THPS 1+2 is that it takes all these gameplay iterations and backports them into the original. Suddenly the original is exactly like you remember it even if what you're remembering is the tight manuals and pivots of THPS 3 superimposed on the haphazard ramps and kickers of The Warehouse. Even in 2003, going back to THPS 1 would have been a frustrating, "why can't I connect these tricks" slog. Like a modern early-access title, THPS didn't find its True Form until it had interacted with its audience and fine tuned itself.

Both these remakes then recognizes that what they're attempting to replicate isn't the literal product, but rather the game we played in our mind's eye.

And then there's the outlier. In the Spring we got probably the most anticipated remake of all-time, FF7 Remake. I wrote a bit about the original game [here](/blog), but to be brief, it was the industry's first true blockbuster. It had the highest budget. It was long (3 discs!). Fans fell in love with the characters. And it conveyed an epic scope. Upon completion, some fans felt they had just lived a second life, beginning to end.

But what was in all those eyes in all those minds? I played FFVII when I was 13, probably the most impressionable and absorbant age of my life. I have some intense memories about an experience that _really got to me_. But I've also played this game fairly recently, nearly all the way through. I used fan-made mods to crisp up polygons and pixels. It looked _alright_. And I noticed (again in my that other post) [everything wrong with it](/blog). It felt awkward. It didn't land.

So I saw the remake as an opportunity to mine the feeling of the 90s. I approached my playthrough with an open mind. "Let's see where this goes... Okay there are a lot of side quests... Jessie's family life seems interesting... Wait why am I spending so much time with Johnny?"

But in harsh retrospect, what was I expecting? There is a beautiful sci-fi epic about some depressed young adults waging a futile war on an uncaring corporation, or maybe just a cyberpunk vignette of lonely alcoholic Shin-re train operator. Both of these might resonate with me, but 99% of fans would hate them. Each of us is cherishing a wholely different idea of good storytelling.

I imagine the team behind Remake got this. We got the graphical upgrades, and busseling community was added to the slums. We could finally stroll from Sector VII to Sector VI, the rotten pizza of the upper city hanging ominously above us, and take it all in. Remake let us picture ourselves as citizens of Midgar and go "okay, I can see how this would all work".

But with regard to its characters and plot, Remake wasn't a remake at all. It was more a reboot.
